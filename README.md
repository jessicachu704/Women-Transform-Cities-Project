## General Information
This is an add-on feature to solve problems on Women Transform Cities website.</br>
This add-on feature allows people who are not members of the organization to contribute and have a say in the ongoing topics/projects without committing to a membership fee. With this feature, users can create an account or log in â€“ and can write their opinions on a topic or start a post.
This will eventually also help WTC to get more supporters, since the more people are involved, the more likely they are to become members, which would also help the organization grow.
